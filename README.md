# Splatoon
## Splatoon plugin has been moved to the following github repository: https://github.com/PunishXIV/Splatoon

# Note from developer
Notice of Splatoon project moving to a different repo
Dear Splatoon users, I would like to inform you that in a collaboration with Puni.sh third party plugin hosting platform, from this day Splatoon plugin will be published there.

This collaboration will benefit Splatoon in long term and will enable the following possibilities:
- Dedicated discord channels for community support and creation/enhancement of presets together. It was not feasible for me to moderate public channels but now they will become a thing with the help of Puni.sh administration. Channels will be launched shortly for patch 6.4!;
- Integration with Puni.sh website, allowing more efficient presets organization in future such as wiki and in-game preset browser/autoloader;
- More visibility to the plugin, allowing it's user base to expand even further.


What will not change:
- I'm not transferring this project to another developer(s) or abandoning it. I will continue developing it just like before, without any changes in this regard;
- You can still use this server or DM if you want a private support from me about any plugin, including Splatoon;

New third party repo URL for Splatoon is: `https://love.puni.sh/ment.json`. Please refer to these installation instructions if you are not sure how to add it: <https://puni.sh/plugin/Splatoon>

To ensure seamless transfer, Splatoon plugin will be published and updated in both repos for at least patch 6.4. However, for issues, pull requests or preset submissions, please use new github repo: <https://github.com/PunishXIV/Splatoon>. 

Additionally, I invite you to check other plugins that are hosted at Puni.sh platform. There are many developers that you already know, and I have been developing some plugins over there as well - for example, AutoRetainer which is an all in one solution for managing your retainers.
