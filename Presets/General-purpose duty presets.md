Marker Placement Helper: Puts lines through the cardinals and intercardinals, a ring around the targeted enemy and a ring in the center of arena to help with placing markers.
Note: Works perfectly in DSR and some other Savage instances.

```

Alternative Marker Placement Helper: Places lines and circle around targeted enemy instead of using coordinates. For use with arenas with weird coordinates.
